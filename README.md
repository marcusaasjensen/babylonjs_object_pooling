# Babylon JS object pooling

Object pooling system implemented for babylon JS games in Typescript.

With node js with npm (version 9.4.2) installed, run ```npx parcel index.html``` inside the project's terminal, then open the localhost link on your browser. 
You will see an example of cubes being spawned each frame (with physics enabled) and being respawned when they are at the last position of the queue (pool in the object pooler).

The initial project scripts come from this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR3iAt5iPoU
